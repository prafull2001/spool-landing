# Spool SEO / ASO / GEO Task List

## IN PROGRESS — New creator AppsFlyer links (2026-08-15)

- [x] Add Peyton bio attribution (`peyton_bio`)
- [x] Add Peyton DM attribution (`peyton_dm`)
- [x] Add Simon bio attribution (`simon_bio`)
- [ ] Add Simon DM attribution (URL is cut off in the supplied screenshot)
- [ ] Add the unlabeled `tom6a7gl` OneLink after its `src` name is supplied

## DONE — Releases tab refresh from iOS Git (2026-08-05)

- [x] Fetch and merge the latest iOS `origin/main` while preserving the local 4.27 version edit
- [x] Diff the 47 commits after the existing July 24 release-context boundary
- [x] Add the live 4.27 release covering product, onboarding, revenue,
      analytics, and comparison caveats
- [x] Update stale version/flow notes with the user-confirmed live boundary
- [x] Run production build/data-shape/diff checks and review the final diff

Implementation note: the Release tab now labels 4.27 as the current live release from 2026-08-05
and closes the 4.21 live window on that date. The new entry covers the 47-commit delta after July
24: exercise interventions, Snapchat and Apps clarity, blocking status/rule presets, flow v10,
Thread display semantics, churn-save offers, and RevenueCat identity/analytics repairs.

Verification note: targeted module assertions confirm 4.27 sorts first, exports as current/live,
closes 4.21 on 2026-08-05, and reports 47 commits; `git diff --check` passes and the 50-page Next.js
production build succeeds. Scoped ESLint could not run because this checkout has no ESLint 9 flat
configuration file.

## DONE — In-app browser App Store handoff (2026-08-01)

- [x] Audit existing App Store CTAs, the `/ig` route, and available attribution configuration
- [x] Add shared Instagram, Threads, Facebook, Messenger, TikTok, iOS, and Android browser detection
- [x] Route every App Store CTA through a synchronous in-app-browser escape with a manual fallback
- [x] Add a noindex `/get?src=<channel>` social-bio redirect page with neutral attribution fallback
- [x] Ensure every `/get?src=` link opens the App Store rather than the homepage on desktop tests
- [x] Pass 4 helper tests, scoped lint with zero errors, a 50-page production build, and local `/get` smoke checks

Implementation note: the repository contains the live iOS App Store URL and now maps the supplied AppsFlyer OneLinks for Spool, Sean, and Alexis ManyChat/bio traffic. The Android package remains unset because Spool is currently iOS-only.

Verification note: the new flat ESLint setup also exposes older errors in unrelated analytics and legal-page files; those pre-existing issues were not changed as part of this task.

## DONE — Remove competitor backlinks (2026-07-31)

- [x] Remove every outbound link to competitor websites while preserving comparison-keyword text
- [x] Add a permanent editorial rule against competitor backlinks
- [x] Build 49 static pages and verify generated HTML contains zero competitor-domain anchors across all 43 sitemap URLs
- [x] Pushed commit `043f14e` to `main`, confirmed Vercel succeeded, and verified all 43 production sitemap URLs

Editorial correction: competitor names may appear as plain text for comparison relevance, but Spool pages must not link to competitor websites or send them referral authority. Link internally to Spool comparison pages and product pages instead.

## DONE — Product-led comparison rewrite (2026-07-31)

- [x] Re-audit SocialLite, Dull, UNDOOMED, and LoomWeb for the search structures they use—not their wording
- [x] Rewrite the new comparison pages so Spool is the clear recommendation without making unverifiable claims
- [x] Remove templated “choose either app” language and replace it with natural, problem-led copy across all comparison pages
- [x] Tighten the comparison hub and AI-readable summaries around Spool's differentiators
- [x] Build 49 static pages, crawl all 43 sitemap URLs locally, and verify comparison/Focus Web schema
- [x] Pushed commit `322aa61` to `main`, confirmed Vercel succeeded, and crawled all 43 production sitemap URLs

Editorial correction: comparison pages must be honest but product-led. Do not create neutral buyer's guides that actively send qualified Spool visitors to competitors. Lead with the searcher's problem, make Spool's combined filtering + voice-reflection mechanism the recommendation, mention competitor advantages only when required for factual credibility, and end with Spool as the next action.

## DONE — SocialLite + Focus Web category language (2026-07-31)

- [x] Added a verified Spool vs SocialLite comparison page and comparison-hub entry
- [x] Defined Focus Web consistently as Spool's social media feed blocker / distraction-free social media browser
- [x] Rebuilt 49 static pages and verified all 43 sitemap URLs return HTTP 200
- [x] Committed only the SEO scope and pushed `codex/focus-web-seo-sociallite`
- [x] Fast-forwarded the tested SEO commits to `main` to trigger the Vercel production build

## DONE — Focus Web SEO cluster (2026-07-31)

- [x] Added a crawlable Focus Web feature hub with a removed-vs-available platform table
- [x] Added exact-intent pages for Instagram, YouTube, X, and Snapchat
- [x] Added evidence-based Spool vs Dull and Spool vs UNDOOMED comparison pages
- [x] Linked the new cluster from the homepage, comparison hub, footer, sitemap, and AI-readable summaries
- [x] Refreshed existing Instagram, YouTube, and X guides so they describe the shipped product accurately
- [x] Built all static routes and verified all 42 sitemap URLs return HTTP 200
