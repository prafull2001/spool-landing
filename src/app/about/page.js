          <p className="about-lede">
            Spool is an iPhone app that helps people stop doomscrolling through AI-powered voice
            check-ins. Instead of blocking apps or showing you a guilt-inducing avatar, Spool asks
            you to <strong>speak your reason out loud</strong> before opening distracting apps like
            TikTok, Instagram, or X — a 5-second pause that interrupts the autopilot habit loop and
            reveals <em>why</em> you reach for your phone, not just how often.

            Spool is the only screen-time app built around verbalized intent. Every other major app

            Spool uses awareness.

          <h2>Why we built Spool</h2>
          <p>
            Doomscrolling isn&apos;t a willpower problem. Apps like Instagram, TikTok, and X are
            engineered by teams of behavioral psychologists to exploit the same dopamine pathways
            that drive gambling addiction. Most screen-time tools fight this with restriction — hard
            blocks, timers, schedules, micro-workouts, wait screens. That friction is a bandaid on a
            deeper issue. Users either bypass it or grow resentful and uninstall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spool takes the only approach that actually produces lasting change: helping you
            understand <em>why</em> you reach for your phone, not just slowing you down with another
            timer. When users articulate out loud why they want to scroll, we mirror their own
            patterns back to them as AI-generated insights. The change comes from inside the user
            rather than being imposed on them. Some have dropped from 6 hours of daily use to 4;
            others describe cutting their use to roughly a quarter of what it was.
          </p>

          <h2>Research foundation</h2>
          <p>
            Spool&apos;s voice check-in mechanism operationalizes <strong>Matthew Lieberman&apos;s
            2007 UCLA research on affect labeling</strong> (Lieberman et al., <em>Putting Feelings
            into Words: Affect Labeling Disrupts Amygdala Activity in Response to Affective
            Stimuli</em>). Lieberman&apos;s fMRI work showed that <strong>naming an urge out loud
            reduces its intensity</strong> by engaging the prefrontal cortex and dampening amygdala
            activity. Spool is, in effect, that finding turned into a product: tap a distracting app,
            name the urge in five seconds, app opens. The pause moves the impulse from reactive
            (amygdala) to deliberative (prefrontal) processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also draw on the welfare-economics literature on digital addiction — specifically{' '}
            <strong>Allcott, Gentzkow &amp; Song (2022), &quot;Digital Addiction&quot;</strong> in
            the <em>American Economic Review</em>, which formalized social media as a habit-forming
            good where users systematically underestimate their future usage. Their finding that
            brief, well-placed commitment devices produce lasting reductions in use is exactly the
            regime Spool&apos;s voice check-in occupies.
          </p>

          <h2>What we&apos;ve learned from 13,000+ voice check-ins</h2>
          <p>
            We capture each user&apos;s statement at the moment of temptation — a category of data
            that&apos;s rare in the digital-wellbeing literature, which tends to rely on
            retrospective self-report. The interior monologue of compulsive phone use turns out to
            be remarkably uniform. <strong>Most users frame their unlock as a first-person want or
            need</strong>, and a small set of phrases recurs across users with no platform-mediated
            connection between them. The actual statements sound like this:
          </p>

          <div className="about-quote is-examples">
            &quot;I just want to scroll for a bit.&quot; &middot; &quot;I just need to check
            something.&quot; &middot; &quot;I want to chill and watch a little bit.&quot;
          </div>

          <p>
            Surfacing those patterns back to the user — &quot;you said &lsquo;just checking&rsquo; 47
            times this week&quot; — is what makes people want to change. Awareness of the script is
            what breaks it.
          </p>

          <h2>What makes Spool different</h2>
          <ul className="about-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Awareness-based, not restriction-based.</strong> Spool does not hard-block
              apps. It captures why you opened them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Voice as the input.</strong> Speaking forces conscious engagement that tapping
              a button cannot.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AI pattern analysis.</strong> Excuses like &quot;just checking&quot; or
              &quot;I&apos;m bored&quot; are tracked and surfaced as personalized insights.

          </ul>

          <div className="about-stats">
            {STATS.map((s) => (
              <div key={s.label} className="about-stat">

                <div className="about-stat-label">{s.label}</div>
              </div>

          <h2>Not the 2012 Spool</h2>
          <p>
            There was a different app called Spool back in 2011–2012 — a read-it-later /
            content-saving service that was acquired by Facebook. We are not affiliated with that
            company. The current Spool, at <strong>thespoolapp.com</strong>, is an iPhone screen-time
            app founded in 2024 by Prafull Sharma. The two share only a name.
