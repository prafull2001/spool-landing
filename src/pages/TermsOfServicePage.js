          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>Welcome to Spool ("the App"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. App Services</h2>
          
          <h3>2.1 Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Block apps using iOS Family Controls APIs</li>

            <li>Monthly Subscription</li>
            <li>Annual Subscription (includes a 2-week free trial)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All prices are shown in your local currency within the App. Prices may vary by region and are subject to change.</p>
          <p>For annual subscriptions, the 2-week trial period begins when you confirm your subscription. No charge will be applied during the trial period. Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase or after the trial period ends.</p>
          <p>The subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your iTunes account settings.</p>
          <p>If you cancel during the trial period, access to App features will end immediately. No refunds will be issued for any unused portion of a subscription period.</p>

          <h3>2.3 App Blocking Functionality</h3>
          <p>The App uses iOS Family Controls APIs to restrict access to selected applications. Blocked apps remain inaccessible according to your settings and schedules. You can configure different blocking durations and schedules within the App.</p>
